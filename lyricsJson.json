inutili guerre\nNon mi avete fatto niente\nLe vostre inutili guerre\nNon avete avuto niente\nLe vostre inutili guerre\n\n[Outro: Fabrizio Moro & Ermal Meta]\nSono consapevole che tutto più non torna\nLa felicità volava\nCome vola via una bolla"},{"artist":"Franka

feel\nYou got me deep inside this love\nYou make my heart go\nWhen I saw your eyes, boy\nYou're just like a movie, black and white\nYou make me go straight out of my mind\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nI swear that I, I would remember\nRoses, and horses, and the rain\nMake it forever and I-I-I-I go\n\n[Chorus]\nCrazy\nGo crazy for your love\nCrazy\nGo crazy for you

my world\nNo I need no diamond or pearls, not that kind of girl\nOver the moon\nI'll be your queen and I'll be your fool\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nSay you'll remember the\nRoses, and horses, and the rain\nMake it forever and I-I-I go\n\n[Chorus]\nCrazy\nGo crazy for your love\nCrazy\nGo crazy for you love\nLo-o-o-ove\nLo-o-o-ove\n\n[Bridge]\nAin't no running, no turning back\nNow I'm caught in your web\nIs it real, I keep asking myself\nSweet fantasy, I can't help, can't hide it\nI'm shooting across the sky\n\n[Outro]\nI'm crazy for your love\nCrazy, I'll go crazy, I'll go crazy\nLo-o-o-ove"},{"artist":"Cláudia Pascoal","title":"O
